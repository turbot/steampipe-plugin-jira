# Jira + Steampipe

[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to plan,
track, and release great software.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List users in your Jira account:

```sql
select
  display_name,
  account_type as type,
  active as status,
  account_id
from
  jira_user;
```

```

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Jira plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install jira
```

### Credentials

| Item        | Description                                                                                                                            |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials | Jira requires an [API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens), site base url and username for all requests. |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single Jira site.                                                                                         |

<!-- | Permissions | Grant the `ReadOnlyAccess` policy to your user or role.                                                                                | -->

### Configuration

Installing the latest jira plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/jira.spc`) with a single connection named `jira`:

```hcl
connection "jira" {
  plugin = "jira"

  # The baseUrl of your Jira Instance API
  # Can also be set with the JIRA_URL environment variable.
  # base_url = "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/"

  # The user name to access the jira cloud instance
  # Can also be set with the `JIRA_USER` environment variable.
  # username = "abcd@xyz.com"

  # Access Token for which to use for the API
  # Can also be set with the `JIRA_TOKEN` environment variable.
  # You should leave it empty if you are using a Personal Access Token (PAT)
  # token = "8WqcdT0rvIZpCjtDqReF48B1"

  # Personal Access Tokens are a safe alternative to using username and password for authentication.
  # This token is used in self-hosted Jira instances.
  # Can also be set with the `JIRA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
  # Personal Access Token can only be used to query jira_backlog_issue, jira_board, jira_issue and jira_sprint tables.
  # personal_access_token = "MDU0MDMx7cE25TQ3OujDfy/vkv/eeSXXoh/zXY1ex9cp"
}
```

- `base_url` - The site url of your attlassian jira subscription.
- `personal_access_token` - [API PAT](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html) for self hosted Jira instances. This access token can only be used to query `jira_backlog_issue`, `jira_board`, `jira_issue` and `jira_sprint` tables.
- `token` - [API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) for user's Atlassian account.
- `username` - Email address of agent user who have permission to access the API.

Alternatively, you can also use the standard Jira environment variables to obtain credentials **only if other arguments (`base_url`, `username` and `token` or `personal_access_token`) are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net/
export JIRA_USER=abcd@xyz.com
export JIRA_TOKEN=8WqcdT0rvIZpCjtDqReF48B1
export JIRA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="MDU0MDMx7cE25TQ3OujDfy/vkv/eeSXXoh/zXY1ex9cp"
```
