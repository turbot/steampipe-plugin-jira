## Quick start

### Install

Download and install the latest Jira plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install jira
```

Configure your [credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/jira#credentials) and [config file](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/jira#configuration).

> The Personal Access Token (PAT) is used for
[self-hosted Jira instances](https://github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira/#bearer---personal-access-tokens-self-hosted-jira).
You should use the `personal_access_token` field instead of `token`.

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/jira.spc`:

```hcl
connection "jira" {
  plugin = jira

  # Authentication information
  base_url              = "https://your-domain.atlassian.net/"
  username              = "abcd@xyz.com"
  token                 = "8WqcdT0rvIZpCjtDqReF48B1"
  personal_access_token = "MDU0MDMx7cE25TQ3OujDfy/vkv/eeSXXoh/zXY1ex9cp"
}
```

Or through environment variables:

```sh
export JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net/
export JIRA_USER=abcd@xyz.com
export JIRA_TOKEN=8WqcdT0rvIZpCjtDqReF48B1
export JIRA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="MDU0MDMx7cE25TQ3OujDfy/vkv/eeSXXoh/zXY1ex9cp"
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

List users in your Jira account:

```sql
select
  display_name,
  account_type as type,
  active as status,
  account_id
from
  jira_user;
```

```
+-------------------------------+-----------+--------+-----------------------------+
| display_name                  | type      | status | account_id                  |
